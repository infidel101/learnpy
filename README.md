# learnpy

Hey! Are you a cybersecurity professional or aspiring cybersecurity professional and would like to learn python in a way that is not focused on data science, finance or any of the many other applications of python? Do you just want to learn from a cybersecurity perspective? Well, you're in the right place!

Please note: I am learning myself and merely following tutorials and hope that you can learn with me :).
Also... I will be posting more of my own invidual projects aswell as what I learn from these tutorials.
